# 🚀 Tweet-Enhancement-for-Higher-Engagement

> **Develop an NLP-powered system that analyzes tweets and suggests enhancements to boost engagement (likes, retweets, reach).**  
> Deliver actionable recommendations for optimizing tweet performance.

---

## 📋 Task Overview

The goal is to create an **NLP-based enhancement model** that:
- Analyzes **tweet text** 📝
- Predicts **virality scores** 📈
- Suggests **improvements** for better engagement 🚀

---

## 🔹 Virality Score Prediction

### 🛠 Pipeline

- **SentenceTransformer + MLP** approach.
- **Embedding:**  
  Tweets are converted into dense vectors using **SentenceTransformer** (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`). 🔠
- **Feature Engineering:**  
  Categorical features (**Weekday, Hour, Day**) are encoded via **Label Encoding**. 🗓️
- **Feature Fusion:**  
  Embeddings and numerical features are concatenated into a single feature vector. ➗
- **Regression Model:**  
  A lightweight neural network (**ViralityRegressor**) predicts a tweet’s virality. 🤖
- **Regularization:**  
  Includes **Dropout** and **LayerNorm** for better generalization. 🔒
- **Optimization:**  
  Trained with **Adam optimizer** and **StepLR** scheduler. ⚙️
- **Batch Processing:**  
  Handled using **DataLoader** for scalability. 📊
- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE) 📏
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE) 📏

### 📈 Performance

| Metric | Score |
|:------:|:-----:|
| MAE    | 0.5644 📉 |
| MSE    | 0.5902 📉 |

## 🔹 Tweet Enhancement

### ✨ TweetEnhancer Class

Custom-built tool to **analyze**, **enhance**, and **optimize** Twitter posts for higher engagement. 🎯

### ⚙️ Features

- **Initialization:**
  - Loads **NLTK** resources (tokenizer, stopwords). 📚
  - Identifies **successful tweets** based on historical data. 🌟
  - Extracts frequent **Calls-to-Action (CTAs)**. 📢
  - Highlights popular **phrases** and **n-grams**. ✍️
  - Analyzes **optimal posting times**. ⏰
  - Collects effective **hashtags**. #️⃣
  - Builds **TF-IDF** vectors for text similarity. 🔍

- **Enhancement (`enhance_tweet` method):**
  - Suggests improved **phrasing**, **CTAs**, and **hashtags**. 🎯
  - (Optional) **Predicts virality** of both original and enhanced tweets (if predictor is provided). 🔮

## 📌 Summary

With this system, users can:
- **Predict** how viral their tweets might be before posting.
- **Enhance** tweets for maximum engagement.
- **Learn** from historical data to continuously improve their Twitter strategies.
