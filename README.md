# Tweet-Enhancement-for-Higher-Engagement
## **Task Overview**  Develop an **NLP-based enhancement model** that analyzes **tweet text** and suggests **improvements** to increase engagement (likes, retweets, and reach). The system should provide actionable recommendations to optimize tweets for better performance.

🔹 Virality Score Prediction

SentenceTransformer + MLP pipeline

SentenceTransformer (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) is used to transform tweets into embeddings. 🔠
Feature Engineering: Categorical features (Weekday, Hour, Day) are encoded using Label Encoding. 🗓️
Feature Fusion: Text embeddings and numerical features are concatenated into a single feature vector. ➗
Regression Model: A small fully connected neural network (ViralityRegressor) predicts the virality of a tweet (regression). 🤖
Regularization: Dropout and LayerNorm are used to enhance model stability. 🔒
Optimization: Training with the Adam optimizer and learning rate scheduler StepLR. ⚙️
Batch Processing: Data is processed in batches via DataLoader for scalability. 📊
Evaluation: MAE and MSE metrics are used to assess model performance. 📏
Performance:

MAE = 0.5644 📉
MSE = 0.5902 📉

🔹 Tweet Enhancement

TweetEnhancer
Custom-built enhancement class for Twitter posts 🚀
Analyzes historical tweets to optimize new ones for higher virality.
Key features:

Loads necessary NLTK resources (tokenizer, stopwords) 📚
During initialization:
Identifies successful tweets (high score) 🌟
Extracts common Calls-to-Action (CTAs) 📢
Highlights popular phrases and n-grams ✍️
Analyzes best posting times ⏰
Gathers effective hashtags #trending
Builds TF-IDF representations for similarity comparison 🔍
During tweet enhancement (enhance_tweet):
Suggests better phrasings, CTAs, and hashtags 🎯
Can predict virality of both original and enhanced tweets (if predictor is provided) 🔮
